## 🎯 Learning Goals

The main goal of **Wrist&Watch** was to strengthen backend fundamentals by building a real-world style project.
Here’s what I learned:

* Structuring an Express app using MVC pattern
* Implementing JWT authentication and secure password hashing
* Managing cookies and flash messages
* Creating and relating Mongoose models
* Rendering dynamic EJS views
* Protecting admin-only routes



## 🚧 Future Improvements

* 🧍‍♀️ User profile page
* 💳 Payment gateway integration
* ☁️ Deployment on Render / Vercel
* 📦 Order tracking system
* 📱 Improved responsive design
